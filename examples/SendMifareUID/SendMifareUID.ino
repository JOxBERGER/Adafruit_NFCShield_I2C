    This example will wait for any ISO14443A card or tag, and
    depending on the size of the UID will attempt to read from it.

    If the card has a 4-byte UID it is probably a Mifare
    Classic card, and the following steps are taken:

    - Authenticate block 4 (the first block of Sector 1) using
      the default KEYA of 0XFF 0XFF 0XFF 0XFF 0XFF 0XFF
    - If authentication succeeds, we can then read any of the
      4 blocks in that sector (though only block 4 is read here)

    If the card has a 7-byte UID it is probably a Mifare
    Ultralight card, and the 4 byte pages can be read directly.
    Page 4 is read by default since this is the first 'general-
    purpose' page on the tags.
